In an interest to keep things that I write here relaxed and fluffy (and without me bothering to go search for a picture of a cat), imagine a picture of a cat.

Now that you have that beautiful and cute picture of a cat, you can continue with this post.

# The Setup

This is meant to be the beginning of the documentation for my idea of a web app that I think would be useful to have. I know that I would use it.

The plan is to create an app that would allow for large configuration of data to easily be put into lists and filtered. Data display solutions that are out there right now need a lot of configuration to go along with them. Most of them seem to require a ton of prior knowledge to know how they work, and maybe it's a problem with the way that I've approached them, but I've found many hurdles in trying to get the data to look exactly like what I pictured in my mind. The other problem, which I'm hoping to address, is that those applications seem to break down when approached with heirarchical data with many dependencies between each level. I know that it's usually a problem with the data's structural design, but with how much data is out there, and how long it's been around, most software can't be burdened with the time it would take to have a rewrite of the data structures.

The plan for this app would be to create simple building blocks that could be combined to make complex listings of objects, and depending on which filters and schemas you were looking at, you could produce pre-packaged data views that people could use. 

I'm finding that the idea is maybe too abstract for the time being, but I'm hoping that with time, it will become clearer what my goals are. 

# Code Line Number 1

The work that I've started yesterday and today is to start developing a configuration page where someone could create the views. I spent a few hours today reworking [react-node-graph](https://github.com/lightsinthesky/react-node-graph) to work with React 16, and it also seemed to have some styling issues because of an old version of font-awesome, so I worked on fixing that as well for my project. At some point I'll make a pull request of my changes, but I noticed that the developer for that package had already started on a new version, so maybe I won't have to wait that long for the official package to be updated.

Here's a screenshot of what I have so far:

It's not much, but it's looking better than when I first imported all of the files for that project. As it is right now, I've separated the server and client code, and they will live in two different GitHub projects. That may prove problematic in the future because of versioning, but hopefully that won't be too much of a problem. (If this project is mainly for my own use, then I won't really care about that until it becomes a problem.) 

The plan is for schemas to be linked to filters, filters to be linked to data views, and data views to be linked to windows. Then you as a user would choose which windows you wanted to see on your dashboard when you log in. I'm planning on using [golden-layout](https://golden-layout.com/) as a docking dashboard, mainly because I've already used on a different project, and now that I've done it once, I can easily do it again. The first time took me a couple of weeks to get working correctly, but now that I understand it, it should be easier.

# Conclusion

That's the plan as it is right now. By writing this down, I feel like I'm forcing myself to commit to giving this my time. To know that I've put it out there in the world already, then it stops me from getting home and immediately lauching Factorio.

Eventually I want to also produce some videos that go over my ideas, but those will be in the future once I've planned out what they'll be about.
