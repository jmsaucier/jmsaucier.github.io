title: Open Source Isn't Leaving

# Do you have time for a Quick Question?

Everyone in an office environment knows how it feels to be interrupted while in the middle of working on something.

> Hey, do you have a minute to answer a quick question?
>                       -- Anyone during a normal day.

Usually these questions are something that's very quick to say, but with any luck, the answer is some meandering description of business logic and intricacies. If not followed to the exact specifications, then entire systems will come to a halt, and the UI will show its own interpretation of what a BSOD should look like. 

In the end, the 10 second question turned into a 30 minute education session about small interactions of much larger systems.

# What about a Quick Complaint?

Quick Complaints have the same problem as quick questions. If I complained, "My hand is killing me. Cacti shouldn't have spikes." What it really boils down to is that I should just stop trying to be Tom Brady with a cacti. 

It's no different than saying, "This third party library crashed on me in a specific edge case. We shouldn't use open source software." The actual problem is my adoption and management of open source libraries that I chose to use.  I should limit their interaction points with my application. Then I can also be more careful about when they are updated.

# Open source is here to stay

It's gone on long enough, that I've grown tired of hearing people complain about open source. Some people are very vocal about their hatred of open source, the web as a platform, and the use of anything other than low level control languages. I classify those people in a league of their own. 

Their complaints are usually knee-jerk and their scenarios don't happen in 90% of regular, business-logic-only programming. In the end, I don't think the problem is "Yay Open Source" or "Nay Open Source". Instead, I think it's just a problem with how the complaints are presented, and because of their nature of work, they don't actually spend time to try and interface with open source software.

Open source works best when it is the edge pieces, and your business logic is the glue that holds the edge pieces all together. We're never going to replace the core of our application with an open source solution (that would mean our application would be useless.) Instead, we abstract ourselves to the level where we're just a lego builder, and the pieces we put together are just legos. 

# Quick Conclusion

I'm sure this argument will last in some form for the next 30 years, but my hope is that people will start to spend time on conversations that are actually useful in the long run. 

This isn't meant to be a final argument for open source. Because of the rambling, I would actually say that it's severely flawed. Instead, it's supposed to be response to the arguments that I usually hear against open source.
